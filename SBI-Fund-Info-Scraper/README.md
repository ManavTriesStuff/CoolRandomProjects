Mini-project :)

Using web-scraping to get SBI fund info from https://www.sbipensionfunds.com/historical-nav/

Selenium driver used to submit a POST form and load new page data.
This HTML is then parsed with Beautiful Soup and converted into a pandas dataframe. 
It is also stored in a .csv file in the same directory.
